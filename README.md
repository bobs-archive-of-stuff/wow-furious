How It Works
============

When the light turns green, YOU FUCKING GO. Fury warriors of MOP should know what this means.

How It Really Works
===================

The addon monitors your two main DPS burst cooldowns: Colossus Smash and Enrage, and attempts to help you maximize your burst DPS in synchronizing the two by showing you when to blow your DPS load via red light and green light.

When you Colossus Smash, the light turns yellow. When you Colossus Smash while enraged, it turns green. Green means go. Also when Execute is ready to go (sub 20% health) a skull appears.

Since maximizing the uptime of Enrage is so important, at the end of combat it will tell you what the Enraged Combat Ratio (ECR) was for that fight, basically how long the fight was to how long you were enraged during it. During combat it tracks the cooldown for Colossus Smash and current rage status.

It tracks your main DPS buffs: Enrage, Avatar, and Recklessness. With the high cooldown time of Avatar and Recklessness, the green light is only cued to Enrage+Smash. The others are tracked and displayed in the witty mood read out.
